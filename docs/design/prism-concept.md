# Prism Programming Language
## Project Vision

Prism aims to bridge the gap between systems and application programming by providing a unified platform that combines safety, performance, and ease of use.

### Core Technical Innovations

1. Hybrid Memory Management
   - Combines Rust-like ownership with automatic reference counting
   - Provides memory safety without full garbage collection overhead
   - Supports both stack and heap allocation with zero-cost abstractions

2. Progressive Type System
   - Implements gradual typing with robust type inference
   - Allows mixing of static and dynamic typing
   - Supports seamless transition from prototype to production code

3. Unified Computing Model
   - Single programming model for CPU/GPU/FPGA
   - Automatic optimization for target hardware
   - Zero-cost abstractions for hardware-specific features

4. Actor-Based Concurrency
   - Message-passing based concurrent programming
   - Static verification of message protocols
   - Built-in deadlock detection
