# FLARECore Programming Language
## Project Vision

FLARECore aims to bridge the gap between systems and application programming by providing a unified platform that combines safety, performance, and ease of use. The language addresses current challenges in software development through innovative approaches to memory management, type systems, and heterogeneous computing.

## Core Technical Innovations

### 1. Hybrid Memory Management
- Combines Rust-like ownership with automatic reference counting
- Provides memory safety without full garbage collection overhead
- Supports both stack and heap allocation with zero-cost abstractions
- Handles cyclic references efficiently using FLAREGuard

### 2. Progressive Type System
- Implements gradual typing with robust type inference
- Allows mixing of static and dynamic typing
- Supports seamless transition from prototype to production code
- Provides cross-module type inference

### 3. Unified Computing Model
- Single programming model for CPU/GPU/FPGA using FLAREVector
- Automatic optimization for target hardware via FLAREBoost
- Zero-cost abstractions for hardware-specific features
- Runtime target selection capabilities

### 4. Actor-Based Concurrency
- Message-passing based concurrent programming
- Static verification of message protocols
- Built-in deadlock detection
- Native async/await support
