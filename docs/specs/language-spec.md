# Prism Programming Language
## Version 0.1 - Technical Specification

### Overview
Prism is a multi-paradigm programming language designed to bridge systems and application programming through innovative memory management, flexible typing, and first-class support for heterogeneous computing.

### Key Design Principles
1. Memory safety without GC overhead
2. Seamless integration across computing platforms
3. Progressive complexity - easy to start, powerful to master
4. Zero-cost abstractions where possible

### Memory Management System
- Rust-style ownership with borrowing as the default
- Automated reference counting for cyclic structures
- Compile-time memory safety guarantees
- Zero-cost abstractions for stack allocation

### Type System
- Optional type annotations
- Powerful type inference across module boundaries
- Seamless interop between typed and untyped code
- Compile-time type checking where types are specified

### Concurrency Model
- Message-passing based concurrency
- Static verification of message protocols
- Automatic deadlock detection
- Built-in async/await support

### Error Handling
- Result type for recoverable errors
- Effect types for side effects
- Static exception tracking
